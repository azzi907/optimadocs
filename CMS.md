Watch the sunset at Es VedrÃ   
Thereâs something about Ibiza. Whether itâs because of the film Fall in love with Ibiza or not, people from all over the world are attracted to this island. It is possible that the rock island Es VedrÃ  has something to do with this. When you wonder what are the highlights in Ibiza? Then you shouldnât miss this sight. There are many myths and legends about Es VedrÃ , but the fact is that it is one of the most magnetic places on earth. Only the North Pole and Bermuda triangle win from this rocky island. One could say that Es VedrÃ  works like a magnet. Once youâve set foot on Ibiza, you keep coming back, donât you? Watch the sunset from the viewpoint and see for yourself what this little island off the coast does to you. Who knows, you might spot a mermaid or a UFO. Do these observations belong to facts or myths? Thatâs up to you to decide.  

Visit one of the caves of Ibiza  
Of course, itâs wonderful to sit on your luxurious sunbed, or to visit one of Ibizaâs famous clubs. But the island has so much more to offer, also in terms of culture. In the north of Ibiza near Puerto de San Miguel, you will find the Cueva De Can Marca. Put this one on your list of Ibiza sights/what to do on Ibiza. When you enter this cave, you literally jump through time. You go back 100,000 years, when the cave was mainly used by smugglers. In addition, this is a useful sight for what to do in Ibiza when it rains, or what to do in Ibiza when itâs very hot.  

Spotting flamingos in Salinas  
Spotting flamingos? In Ibiza? Yes, you read it well. You donât have to go all the way to Aruba to spot these graceful birds. In the south of Ibiza lies the Ses Salinas nature reserve, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Here you will find the salt plains where you can walk endlessly and, with a bit of luck, see the flamingos bathe. There are also several beaches that are more than worthwhile, such as Es Cavallet where you can enjoy a delicious lunch at La Escollera. Or the beach of Salinas where Beso Beach is an excellent choice to spend a day.  All highlights in Ibiza.

Stroll through the charismatic Dalt Villa  
What to do in Ibiza? One of the most famous sights of Ibiza, a visit to Dalt Villa, cannot be missed. Dalt Villa is the old city centre of Ibiza Town, which is written in Catalan as Eivissa. When you walk through the impressive city walls, you will end up in the medieval old town. Every year, several events are organised here, such as the Ibiza Medieval Fair and Solomun also runs here once a year between the old city walls. The idyllic area is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Stroll through the romantic streets and eat at La Olivia. Walk straight on to the highest point for panoramic views over the harbour, where you can see the lights of club LÃ­o shining over the water in the evening.  

Dance, shop or eat at Las Dalias  
The last on the list of What to do in Ibiza, these sights should not be missed is Las Dalias. Personally, we are not such a fan of the tourist hippy markets, but Las Dalias in San Carlos is of a different calibre. Here you can stroll around the authentic market all year round. From art, to leather goods and jewellery. Most of the items youâll find here are made locally. Every Wednesday in high season, NamastÃ© is organised and that is (again) a party of a very different kind. Here all free spirits come together to dance to Balearic Beats with the most beautiful light shows. Hippie, hipster or Quote-500 rating, everyone comes together here. Besides Las Dalias, Las Dalias CafÃ© is also one of the attractions of Ibiza that you want to try. Here you will find a varied menu that is suitable for both carnivores and herbivores and you can taste the authentic Ibiza.  

Cala BenirrÃ s 
This beautiful beach in the north is usually an oasis of peace. Except on Sundays, when all the drummers of Ibiza gather here to celebrate life. On Sundays it is especially busy in the summer months, but that makes this place very vibrant. Do you want the golden tip what to do on Ibiza? Then book a table at beach restaurant Elements on Sunday. Also here on Sunday in the evening, the tables are put aside, and a DJ is playing great beats, creating the perfect ambiance. That is: a mix of the authentic hippie culture and the mundane Ibiza. Write this tip quickly on your list of highlights in Ibiza, because you donât want to miss these sights either.
